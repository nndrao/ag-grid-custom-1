# Performance Optimization Summary

## Issues Found in Logs
1. Profile settings were being applied twice when switching profiles
2. Grid was being refreshed multiple times (4+ times) during profile switch
3. Both ProfileManager and data-table component were applying settings
4. Multiple setTimeout calls creating timing issues

## Optimizations Made

### 1. Single Point of Settings Application
- Removed duplicate profile application from `data-table.tsx`
- Profile settings are now only applied by ProfileManager
- `useAgGridProfileSync` hook now only handles font updates

### 2. Batch Grid Updates
- Removed individual refreshes from:
  - `applyGridOptions()` method
  - `applyGridState()` method
  - Individual setting applications in dialogs
- Added single `requestAnimationFrame` refresh after all settings are applied

### 3. Improved Timing
- Replaced multiple `setTimeout` calls with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Removed unnecessary delays between operations
- Settings are applied synchronously where possible

### 4. Reduced Redundancy
- Skip applying unchanged grid options
- Consolidate all grid refreshes into one operation
- Remove duplicate cellStyle testing and application

## Performance Benefits

### Before Optimization:
- 2 full profile applications
- 4+ grid refreshes per profile switch
- Multiple setTimeout delays adding ~400ms
- Redundant option applications

### After Optimization:
- 1 profile application
- 1 grid refresh per profile switch
- Single requestAnimationFrame (~16ms)
- Only changed options applied

## Expected Results
- Faster profile switching (200-300ms faster)
- No grid flickering during settings application
- Smoother user experience
- More efficient use of browser resources

## Verification
Monitor console logs during profile switch:
- Should see only one "Applying profile settings" log
- Should see only one "Single final grid refresh" log
- No duplicate option applications
- Cleaner, more concise log output
