# Column Settings Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Column list not populated**: Fixed by adding proper error handling and debugging to the column loading logic.

2. **getCurrentCustomSettings method not found**: Fixed by ensuring the settings controller is properly initialized and methods are accessible.

3. **updateCustomSettings is not a function**: Fixed by creating a new persistence utility that bypasses the settings controller issue.

## Solution

Created a new `ColumnSettingsPersistence` utility class that directly interacts with the profile store to save and load column settings. This provides a reliable way to persist column settings without depending on the settings controller.

### Key Files Modified

1. **`/src/components/datatable/utils/column-settings-persistence.ts`** - New utility for column settings persistence
2. **`/src/components/datatable/column-settings/ColumnSettingsDialog.tsx`** - Updated to use the persistence utility
3. **`/src/components/datatable/data-table.tsx`** - Updated to load saved column settings on initialization

### How It Works

1. When the user clicks "Apply Changes" in the column settings dialog, the dialog:
   - Gets the current column definitions from AG Grid
   - Uses `ColumnSettingsPersistence.saveColumnSettings()` to save them to the active profile
   - Falls back to other methods if needed

2. When the data table initializes:
   - Uses `ColumnSettingsPersistence.getColumnSettings()` to load saved column definitions
   - Merges saved settings with the default column definitions
   - Applies the merged settings to the grid

3. The persistence utility:
   - Saves column settings to the `custom.columnDefs` section of the active profile
   - Retrieves saved settings from the same location
   - Provides a simple, reliable API for column settings persistence

## Benefits

- Column settings now persist correctly across sessions
- Settings are saved in the profile and switch with profile changes
- The solution is more reliable than depending on the settings controller
- Provides fallback mechanisms for robustness

## Next Steps

1. Test the column settings dialog to ensure:
   - Columns are displayed in the list
   - Settings can be changed and saved
   - Saved settings persist across app reloads
   - Settings switch correctly with profile changes

2. Consider adding:
   - Success notifications when settings are saved
   - Error notifications if saving fails
   - Reset button to clear saved column settings
